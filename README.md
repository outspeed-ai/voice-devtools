## Quick Start

1. Get your API keys:

   - [Outspeed API key](https://dashboard.outspeed.com)
   - [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/settings/api-keys)

2. Set up environment:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Add your API keys to .env:
   # OPENAI_API_KEY="<your-openai-key>"
   # OUTSPEED_API_KEY="<your-outspeed-key>"
   ```

3. Install and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the console.

### Usage

To modify agent prompt and tools, modify `agent-config.js`.

To modify the model parameters like (voice, version, etc.), edit `model-config.js`


### Agents

There are two voice agent examples already present in `agent-config.js`:
1. Dental Agent: Answers callers' questions about working hours of a dental clinic
2. Message Agent: Takes callers' messages for a person

You can modify the export in the file to activate an agent:

```js
// agent-config.js
export { dental_agent as agent }

// for message_agent
export { message_agent as agent }
```

Play around with the prompts, or add your own voice agent to give it a spin.
